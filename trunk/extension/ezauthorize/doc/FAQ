eZ Authorize extension v1.4.0 FAQ

1. Authorize.net API Support
=================================================
* Designed to support Authorize.Net (API) AIM version 3.1

1.1 Authorize.Net Resources
=================================================
http://authorize.net/

General Information:
http://developer.authorize.net/
http://authorize.net/resources/documentlibrary/

API Guide:
http://www.authorize.net/support/AIM_guide.pdf


2. Required Fields
=================================================
* Oddly enough, 3 of the most standard fields on
  a payment form are not actually required by the
  authorize.net payment gateway:

  Name on Card, Card Type, and Security Number (CVV2)

  Reasons

  - The Name just doesn't matter

  - The card type is determined automatically
    based on the card number,

  - The security number is analyzed but it isn't
    currently handled as an error if it doesn't match.


3. Default Delimiter
=================================================
* The pipe "|" character is the default delimiter,
  which is currently hardcoded in the class.


4. Payment Type Support
=================================================
* eZ Authorize supports only credit card
  transactions right now.

* eZ Authorize does not impliment support for 
  the eCHECK or WellsFargo SecurePay APIs.


5. Select Gateway
=================================================
* This extension overrides the following template
  and customized to simplify the checkout process 
  for the customer by making the default action
  to continue forward in the checkout process.

Default Template design/standard/templates/workflow/selectgateway.tpl
eZ Authorize Template: extension/ezauthorize/design/standard/templates/workflow/selectgateway.tpl

To disable this template override all you must do is rename the file.


6. Test Mode
=================================================
* To switch test mode off, open up ezauthorize.ini.append.php
  and switch "TestMode=TRUE" to "TestMode=FALSE".

Also make sure you have the proper settings in your
Authorize.Net merchant login control panel.


7. Referencs
=================================================
* This implimentation was based originally in part on the 
  Cetrel Payment Gatway by Bertrand Dunogier from Interact S.A.

* Portions of this the file classes/ezauthorizeaim.php 
  are based on Micah Carrick's Authorize.Net php class, 
  available at: http://www.micahcarrick.com/v2/content/view/2/3/

* Christian Grey provided the eZ publish community with
  improved php 4.4+ and eZ publish 3.7+ compatibility by
  alerting us to the need to upgrade eZ authorize to
  support php 4.4.4 and eZ publish 3.8 by removing
  deprecated call-time pass-by-reference(s) in v1.1.0

* Bjorn Dieding (xrow) provided the eZ publish community 
  with improved php 4.4+ support, sslverify support + cacert bundle,
  and optional fields to better track a transaction.


8. Testing
=================================================
* This has only been completely tested using 
  test mode, and has not yet been used for live transactions.
