http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_3_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ publish 3.7 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/installation
and
http://ez.no/doc


Installing eZ Authorize extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezauthorize-1_4_0.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezauthorize-1_4_0.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=ezauthorize

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezauthorize


4. We must now configuration eZ Authorize

   You will need to edit the ezauthorize.ini.append.php file and put
   in your merchant id and transaction key. Alternately you may create
   an override copy of this file.

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/ezauthorize.ini.append(.php)
   But you will need to edit these lines:

   [eZAuthorizeSettings]
   MerchantLogin=eZC_test042
   TransactionKey=A42QrHBcRe7KrCkRXxX
   TestMode=TRUE

   Note:
   ==============================
   To switch eZ Authorize mode from test to live,
   thus turning test mode off.

   Open the file ezauthorize.ini.append(.php)
   and switch "TestMode=TRUE" to "TestMode=FALSE".

   Make sure you have the proper settings in your
   Authorize.Net merchant login control panel.


5. Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   A) In the eZ publish admin, go to Setup -> Workflows
      and click New Workflow Group.

   B) Name the group something like "All Payment Gateways" and click OK.
      The group will be added to the workflow groups.

   C) Click on the group you have just created, and in the
      Workflows box click the "New Workflow" button.

      1) Name the workflow "Payment Workflow".

      3) You will now see an Event select dropdown.
         1) Select "Event / Payment Gateway"

         2) Confirm you choice by clicking the "Add Event" button
            just to the right of the select dropdown.

      4) Enter a description "Authorize.Net Payment Gateway"

      5) Select a type from the multi-select list.

         If the extension has been properly installed,
         you will see Authorize.Net in the new multi-select
         box you are presented with.

         You can choose, "All" or "Authorize.Net" from the multi-select
         box to support one or many Payment Gatways.

	 a) Selecting "All" will allow the customer to select a payment
            method for themselves at checkout. This would allow the customer
            to pay using either Paypal or Authorize.Net
	 b) Selecting "Authorize.Net" will allow the customer to submit
            credit card payment using Authorize.Net


   G) Now click on the Triggers link in the left hand menu.

      In the table "Workflow Triggers" you will see a list of available triggers.

      On the line: shop, sheckout, before, (Workflow Drop Down)
      "Click" the dropdown select the payment gateway event
      you have just created.

   H) After you have followed all these steps, the extension's
      workflow settings should be activated, configured and functioning properly.


6. Shop Checkout: Testing Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   After completing the above setup you should login to eZ publish
   add a product to your basket, proceed to checkout, enter your
   account information and confirm your order.

   Next, (depending on the Event Type selected in the worlkflow setup)
   you should be presented with a form.

   A) Either "Select gateway" (*) Paypal ( ) Authorize.Net
   B) Or "Payment Information" (Authorize.Net) input form 
      after selecting "Confirm" during the checkout process.

   C) Alternately if you would like your customers to be able to choose their
      method of payment, during step 5 you can select "All" instead of
      Authorize.Net in the multi select box. This will give the customer the
      choice of using paypal or authorize.net (or any other payment gateway you
      choose to add) when they click "Confirm" during checkout.

Usage
==============================
To switch test mode off, open up authorize.net.append.php
and switch "TestMode=TRUE" to "TestMode=FALSE".

Also make sure you have the proper settings in your
Authorize.Net merchant login control panel.
