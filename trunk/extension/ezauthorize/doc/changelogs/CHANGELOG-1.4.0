- Removed settings/workflow.ini* as not required.  This extension doesn't
  create a new workflow but an "plugin" to the existing core "Payment Gateway"
  workflow.  This change stops the following errors occuring:

  eZWorkflowType::loadAndRegisterType:
    Workflow type not found: event_ezauthorize, searched in these directories: kernel/classes/workflowtypes
- Fixed minor XHTML issues and accessability issues
- Payment Information: Year dropdown is now dynamic, starting at current year
- Payment Information: Month dropdown is now dynamic - less repeated code, possibly slower
- Added path so title displayed
