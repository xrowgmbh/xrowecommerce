eZ Paypal Payment Gateway extension [ExtensionVersion] FAQ

1. eZ Paypal Payment Gateway is not activated in eZ publish
===========================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Edit `settings/override/site.ini.append' or `settings/override/site.ini.append'
and find the `ExtensionSettings' group. Under it you should have an entry
that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=ezpaypal

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output of eZ publish to see what is
going wrong.
